# ShopNest Retail Analytics Dashboard

### Project Overview
This capstone project involves the design and implementation of an interactive Power BI dashboard to centralize and analyze over 100,000 e-commerce transaction records. The primary goal was to provide business users with a unified, data-driven view of key metrics that were previously fragmented, helping to overcome the lack of unified insights into sales, delivery performance, and product ratings.

### Key Features & Dashboard Insights
The dashboard provides clear, actionable visuals for diverse user roles, enabling proactive decision-making. Key analytical features include:
* **Deep Business Analysis:** Utilizes 15+ advanced DAX measures and calculated columns to derive complex business insights.
* **Interactive Exploration:** Incorporates cross-filtering and drill-through features for intuitive, multi-dimensional data exploration.
* **Automated Reporting:** Automates data refreshes through Power Query and parameterizes data sources for seamless real-time updates.
* **Performance Monitoring:** Empowers logistics and business teams to proactively identify month-over-month delivery delays, monitor high/low-performing products, and detect evolving sales trends.

### Technologies Used
* **Power BI Desktop:** For dashboard design and visualization.
* **Power Query:** For data transformation and automation.
* **DAX:** For advanced measures and business logic.

### Project Impact
The dashboard eliminated manual reporting, significantly improved decision-making speed, and established a single source of truth for the organization. This has led to strategic improvements across the business and logistics teams.
